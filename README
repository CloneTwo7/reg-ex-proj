Files contained in the folder:
-> Main.java
   -> 	This file contains the code for handling interactions with the stack.
-> RegExStack.java
   -> 	This file contains code that handles a stack containing NFA state 
	machine objects. It determines what happens when a pop, push, or 
	print is called.
-> NFA.java
   -> 	This file contains code that determines how an NFA object should 
	behave. It handles how transitions are added to an NFA, and has 
	methods for concatination, union operations, and klene star operations.
-> Transtions.java
   -> 	This file contains code that determines how Transition objects are 
	created and handled. It determines what states are contained in the 
	transition, and what symbol is associated with said transition.

Compiler: javac 18.0.2

Compile Instructions: [I have never created a java README before so I apologize]
-> Run the following command in the terminal as follows:

	$javac Main.java NFA.java RegExStack.java Transitions.java

-> That will compile the code such that you can run it.
-> Tip: Technically the assignment clarified "Makefile is ***recommended***" 
-> To run the code, follow the bellow execution method:

	$java Main [filename/path]

-> Be amazed
